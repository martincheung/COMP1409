PROJECT TITLE: Assignment 2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: COMP 1409 Assignment 2
VERSION or DATE: 20150609
AUTHORS: Martin Cheung


1. For the Ecosystem's getGuppyPopulation() method, I decided not to use the getPopulationSize() method of the Pool class
because you did not specify for that method whether to return all guppies alive or dead or only live guppies.
Therefore, I created a nest for loop to count the number of alive guppies in the local variable aliveGuppyCount.
